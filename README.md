# Todos with Angular 4 and Redux | Lesson on Coding

A simple todos application built with the Angular 4 framework and redux. This project was built off my
[Angular Wepack Starter](https://github.com/Bigless27/Angular-webpack-starter) skeleton.


### Dependencies
  - Make sure you install json-server globally `npm install json-server -g`
  - Make sure you install chrome redux dev tools when using the application in dev mode. 
  - If you want to use the project without the redux dev tools edit the enhancers in the app.module.ts file

### How to Run (dev server)
- npm install
- npm run start
- json-server db.json (run from root in another tab)
